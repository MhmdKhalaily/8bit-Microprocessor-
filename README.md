# 8bit-Microprocessor
8 Bit Microprocessor Design Using VHDL on FPGA Purpose: 1-FPGA-based 8-bit simple microprocessor designed using the VHDL language. 
Theory: Microprocessors are the heart of any electronic device we use in our everyday life.
The efficiency of these processors depend on the speed of execution and simplified and reconfigurable programming. 
The design of such reconfigurable processors can be done using FPGA, as FPGA devices are reconfigurable, which make them unique than any other type of devices.
